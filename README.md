# Developping a Sentiment Analysis Model

During this project, I develop 3 different types of Sentiment Analysis models: 

- A Basic model developed with Azure ML Designer
- A Commercial API application built with the Azure Cognitive services API
- An Advanced model developed with Keras - Tensorflow

The models are based on the [Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
containing 1.6 million tweets.

The Advanced model is built with a BERT encoder and a custom Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as a decoder.
